\begin{enumerate}
\item If I have 50 joules of energy, what is the maximum amount of work I could possibly do with that amount of energy?
\item If I am using up 10 joules of energy each second, how many watts am I using up?
\item If I convert 30 watts of mechanical power into electrical power with 50\% efficiency, how many watts of electrical power are delivered?
\item If I have a circuit powered by a $9\myvolt$ battery that uses $0.125\myamp$, how many watts does that circuit use?
\item If a resistor has a $2\myvolt$ drop with a $0.03\myamp$ current, how much power is the resistor dissipating?
\item If a resistor has a $3\myvolt$ drop with a $12\mymamp$ current, how much power is the resistor dissipating?
\item If a $700\myohm$ resistor has a $5\myvolt$ drop, how much power is the resistor dissipating?
\item If a $500\myohm$ resistor has $20\mymamp$ flowing through it, how much power is the resistor dissipating?
\item In the circuit below, calculate the voltage drop, current, and power dissipation of every component (except the battery). \\ \includegraphics[scale=0.08]{ExampleForPowerDissipation.png}
