% FIXME - do I want to do my schematics as PNGs or as vectors?  iCircuit does weird stuff with vectors.
% FIXME - need to normalize ''exercises'' vs ''apply''
% FIXME - move everything to a power module early on
% FIXME - for some reason, Fritzing sometimes puts out a PDF 1.4 and sometimes 1.3.  xetex is choking on the 1.4s.  If this happens, to convert, rename FILE.pdf to FILE.1.4.pdf and run 
% gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 -o FILE.pdf FILE.1.4.pdf

% FIXME - decide whether to use 9v battery or power module
% FIXME - replace buttons with two-terminal buttons
% FIXME - replace PNG output of icircuit and Fritzing with PDF; perhaps remove Fritzing logo

% FIXME - some things we need to be sure we describe:
%          1) That current only flows in one direction in a given wire
%          2) that current generally follows the path of least resistance
%          2a) in the diode chapter, if it has a choice between direct-to-ground and diode-to-ground, it will choose direct and not go through the diode, because it is the easier path
% FIXME - somewhere toward the beginning we need anode, cathode, leads, legs, packaging, and parts of a component, with a resistor and diode examples.
% FIXME - also need to talk about k/m/u/M/n/p prefixes early on

% FIXME - on all my Fritzing diagrams, I probably need to mark +/- power rails since it will print black and white

% FIXME - I know I talk about digital, but do I ever *define* analog anywhere?

% FIXME - make sure I say that legs, leads, and terminals all mean the same thing

% FIXME - I should put in an early chapter that you can use the power module instead of just a 9V for most projects and they work out just fine.  Maybe have a short appendix on that or something. ``connecting power to your projects''.  Mention that we do 9V direct just to make sure that the student knows there is nothing up our sleeve.

% FIXME - be sure to include non-math exercises in each section for younger learners who are just trying to get a conceptual grasp
% FIXME - should have drawing questions a lot more - start with drawing how the breadboard is connected
% FIXME - rearrange early chapters to have more than one on resistance and series and parallel
% FIXME - should have an appendix with a bunch of math
