\begin{enumerate}
\item Practice modifying and uploading the Blink program to the Arduino Uno.  Change the numbers given to \icode{delay} to different values, and see how that affects the operation of the program.
\item The ATmega328/P is only one of many different microcontrollers available in the AVR family.  Research online to find one or two other AVR chips and what different features they have.
\item The AVR family is only one of many microcontroller families.  Research one or two other microcontroller families and look at what features are claimed for each.  Examples of other microcontroller families include: PIC, STM32, MSP432, and the Intel Quark.
\item Go to the \icode{arduino.cc} website and look at the different types of Arduinos that are available.  What makes them different?  Why might you choose one for a project over another?
\end{enumerate}
