\begin{enumerate}
\item If I have an RC circuit with a resistor of $10\myohm$ and a capacitor of $2\myf$, what is the RC time constant of this circuit?
\item In the previous question, how many seconds does it take to charge my capacitor to approximately 50\% of supply voltage?
\item If I have an RC circuit with a resistor of $30,000\myohm$ and a capacitor of $0.001\myf$, what is the RC time constant of this circuit?
\item In the previous question, what percentage of the way is the capacitor charged after 60 seconds?
\item If I have an RC circuit with a resistor of $25\mykohm$ and a capacitor of $20\myuf$, what is the RC time constant of this circuit?
\item Give a resistor and capacitor combination that will yield an RC time constant of 0.25 seconds.
\item Reconfigure the circuit in Figure~\ref{figSimpleTimerCircuit} to wait for 3 seconds.  Draw the whole circuit.
\item Redraw the previous circuit, and circle each basic circuit pattern and label it.
