All measured values should be measured using the ranging technique discussed in this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with the circuit you built in Figure~\ref{figBreadboardBeginFour}.  Measure the voltage drop across the resistor, then measure the voltage drop across the LED.  Now, measure the voltage drop across both of them (put the red multimeter lead on the left side of the resistor and the black multimeter lead on the right side of the LED).  Write down your values.
\item Using the same circuit, change the LED from red to blue.   Measure the values again and write them down.  Measure the current going through the circuit using any wire.  Is it the same or different than before?
\item Add another LED in series with the one you have already.  Measure the voltage drops between each side of each component in the circuit.  Measure the current going through any given wire.  Write down each value.
\item Take the new circuit you built in the previous problem and draw the schematic for the circuit.
\end{enumerate}
