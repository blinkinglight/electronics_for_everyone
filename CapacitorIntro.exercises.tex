\item Convert $23\myf$ to microfarads.
\item Convert $15\myuf$ to farads.
\item Convert $0.0002\myf$ to microfarads.
\item Convert $0.0030\myuf$ to farads.
\item If a voltage of $6\myvolt$ is applied to a $55\myuf$ capacitor, how much charge would it store?
\item If a voltage of $2\myvolt$ is applied to a $13\mypf$ capacitor, how much charge would it store?
\item If a $132\myuf$ capacitor is holding $0.02\textrm{ coulombs}$ of charge, how many volts will it produce when it discharges?
\item if a $600\mypf$ capacitor is holding $0.03\textrm{ coulombs}$ of charge, how many volts will it produce when it discharges?
\item If a $121\myuf$ capacitor is connected to a battery.  After some fluctuation, the capacitor has $0.00089\textrm{ coulombs}$ of charge stored in it and the battery is reading $8.9\myvolt$.  Is the capacitor going to be charging or discharging at this point?
