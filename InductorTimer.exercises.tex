\item What is the time constant of a series circuit consisting of a $50\myohm$ resistor and a $2\myhy$ inductor?
\item What is the time constant of a series circuit consisting of a $10\myohm$ resistor and a $5\myuhy$ inductor?
\item If I have a $9\myvolt$ battery and I connect it to a series circuit consisting of a $1\mykohm$ resistor and a $23\myuhy$ inductor, how much time will it take before the current through the inductor reaches approximately 87\% of its maximum value?
\item If I have a $5\myvolt$ source and I connect it to a series circuit consisting of a $2\mykohm$ resistor and a $6\myuhy$ inductor, how much time will it take before the voltage across the inductor falls below $0.25\myvolt$.
\item If I have a circuit that has unwanted high-pitched noise, what component can I wire in series with the circuit to remove the noise?
\item If I have a circuit that has unwanted high-pitched noise, what component can I wire in parallel with the circuit to remove the noise?
\item What types of currents does an inductor (a) block and (b) allow?
\item What types of currents does a capacitor (a) block and (b) allow?
\item If I am building a radio, I need to allow through only very specific frequencies.  What component or combination of components would I use to do this?
