\chapter{Common Integrated Circuits}

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to a few Integrated Circuits that are commonly used, that illustrate a principle of circuit design, and that you have enough knowledge to use well.
In this chapter, we will cover:
\begin{enumerate}
\item FIXME - some sort of flip-flop or latch
\item FIXME - some kind of counter
\item FIXME - nand gate
\item FIXME - A/D with 7seg driver?
\item FIXME - shift register?
\item FIXME - schmitt trigger?
\item FIXME - level shifter?
\end{enumerate}

More types of ICs can be found in Appendix~\ref{SimplifiedDatasheets}.
