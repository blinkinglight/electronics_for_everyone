\begin{enumerate}
\item Why is the input voltage signal to the 555 timer smooth, but the output is square?
\item Will increasing the resistance of R1 and R2 make the pitch higher or lower?
\item Can you think of a way to modify the circuit so that the pitch of the sound can be adjusted while the circuit is on? 
\item Given the circuit in Figure~\ref{figSimpleToneGenerator}, what power would be delivered to your headphones if you were using an $8\myohm$ speaker instead of the $16\myohm$ speaker?  What about a $100\myohm$ speaker?
\item The frequency of the A note above middle-C on the piano is $440\myhz$.  Design a modification to this circuit that will yield this frequency.
\item The output of the 555 is $1.7\myvolt$ less than the power supply used.  What is the effect on the wattage to the headphones if we change the power supply to be a $9\myvolt$ power supply?
\end{enumerate}
