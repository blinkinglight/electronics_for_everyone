\begin{enumerate}
\item  Calculate the amount of current flowing through each element of the circuit in Figure~\ref{figSimpleComparatorCircuit}.  You can presume that the LM393 uses about $1\mymamp$ for its own operation, and that the LED is a red, $1.8\myvolt$ LED.  What is the total amount of current used by the circuit?
\item Take the circuit in Figure~\ref{figSimpleComparatorCircuit} and swap which voltage divider is attached to \icode{1IN+} and \icode{1IN-}.  Now calculate the total amount of current used by this circuit.
\item The Spectra Flex Sensor is a resistive sensor that changes its resistance when bent.  When it is straight, it has a resistance of $10\mykohm$.  When it is bent, it has resistances of $60\mykohm$ and above.  Draw a circuit that turns on an LED when the resistor is bent.  You may invent your own symbol for the flex sensor.
\item Build the circuit in Figures~\ref{figDarknessSensorCircuit} and~\ref{figDarknessSensorBreadboard}. 
\item If you wanted to wait until the room was even darker before the LED went on, how would you change the circuit?
