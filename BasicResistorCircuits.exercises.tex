\begin{enumerate}
\item In Figure~\ref{figMultipleSwitches}, calculate the amount of current used by the whole circuit for each configuration of the switches S2 and S3 when S1 is closed.  You can assume that the LEDs are red LEDs.
\item Build the circuit given in Figure~\ref{figMultipleSwitches} (you may swap out resistors with different but similar values---anything from $300\myohm$ to about $5\mykohm$ should work).
\item Given a $15\myvolt$ voltage supply, what size of a resistor would be needed to make sure that a circuit never went over $18\mymamp$.
\item Given a $9\myvolt$ battery source, design a voltage divider that will output $7\myvolt$ to a load that has a resistance of $10\mykohm$.
\item Given a $3\myvolt$ battery source, design a voltage divider that will output $1.5\myvolt$ to a load that has a resistnace of $1\mykohm$.
\item In Figure~\ref{figPullUpResistorBasic}, how much current is going through the circuit when the switch is open?  How much when it is closed?
\item How would you modify the circuit in Figure~\ref{figPullUpResistorBasic} to keep the maximum current in the circuit under $2\mymamp$?  Draw the full circuit out yourself.
\item Build the circuit you designed in the previous question.  If you do not have the right resistor values, use the closest ones you have.
