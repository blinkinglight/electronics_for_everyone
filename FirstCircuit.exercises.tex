\textbf{Special Note} - In the problems below, since we have not yet studied LED operation in-depth, we are ignoring the electrical characteristics of the LED and just focusing on the resistor.  
If you know how to calculate the circuit characteristics using the LED, please ignore it anyway for the purpose of these exercises.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the amount of current running in the circuit you built in this chapter using Ohm's law.  Since Ohm's law gives the results in amps, convert the value to milliamps.
\item Let's say that the minimum amount of current needed for the LED to be visibly on is 1 milliamp.  What value of resistor would produce this current?
\item Let's say that the maximum amount of current the LED can handle is 30 milliamps.  What value of resistor would produce this current?
\item Draw a circuit diagram of a short circuit.
\item Take the circuit drawing in this chapter, and modify it so that it is an open circuit.
\item Draw a circuit with just a battery and a resistor.  Make up values for both the battery and the resistor and calculate the amount of current flowing through.
\end{enumerate}
