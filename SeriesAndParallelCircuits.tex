\chapter{Series and Parallel Circuits}

In the Chapter~\ref{chapFirstCircuit} we looked at our very first circuit and how to draw it using a circuit diagram.
In this chapter, we are going to look at different ways components can be hooked together and what they mean for your circuit.

\section{A Series Circuit}

The circuit built in Chapter~\ref{chapFirstCircuit} is considered a \glossterm{series circuit} because all of the components are connected end-to-end, one after another.
In a series circuit, there is only one pathway for the current to flow, making analyzing the circuit fairly simple.

It does not matter how \emph{many} components are connected together---as long as all of the components are connected one after another, the circuit is considered a series circuit.
