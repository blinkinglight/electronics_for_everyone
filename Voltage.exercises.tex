\begin{enumerate}
\item If I have a 4-volt battery, how many volts are between the positive and negative terminals of this battery?
\item If I choose the \emph{negative} terminal of this battery as my ground, how many volts are at the \emph{negative} terminal?
\item If I choose the \emph{negative} terminal of this battery as my ground, how many volts are at the \emph{positive} terminal?
\item If I choose the \emph{positive} terminal of this battery as my ground, how many volts are at the \emph{negative} terminal?
\item Given a constant voltage, what effect does increasing the resistance have on current?
\item Given a constant current, what effect does increasing the resistance have on voltage?
\item If I have a 10-volt battery, how much resistance would I need to have a current flow of 10 amps?
\item If I have a 3-volt battery, how much resistance would I need to have a current flow of 15 amps?
\item Given 4 amps of current flow across 200 ohms of resistance, how much voltage is there in my circuit?
\item If I am wanting to limit current flow to 2 amps, how much resistance would I need to add to a 40-volt source?
\item If I am wanting to limit current flow to 2 milliamps, how much resistance would I need to add to a 9-volt source?
