\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the purpose of the resistor in the collector of a transistor amplifier?
\item What is the purpose of the resistor in the emitter of a transistor amplifier?
\item Why is there a bias voltage on the base of the transistor?  Why can't the signal just be connected in directly to the base?
\item Why is the signal coupled in through a capacitor?
\item Why does the single stage voltage amplifier discussed in this chapter invert its output?
\item If the output of the two-stage amplifier is coupled into a third stage, the signal current would swing $1.85\mymamp$ in either direction.  Design a third amplification stage which can handle this amount of current.
\end{enumerate}
