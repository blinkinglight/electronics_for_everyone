\begin{enumerate}
\item If you wanted to prevent too much current from going through a motor, what should you use for this?
\item What happens to the RPM of a motor when I reduce the voltage to my motor?
\item What should be attached to a motor to protect the other parts of the circuit when a motor is shut-off?
\item List one reason why a series resistor should not be used with a motor.
\item If I was building a robot and wanted to control the angle of a robot's arm, what type of motor could I use?
\item If I was building a machine to place components into a precise position onto a board, what type of motor should I pick to achieve that precision?
